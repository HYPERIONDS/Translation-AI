      question: 'How does the video dubbing feature work?',
      answer: 'Our video dubbing feature uses AI to extract audio from your video, translate it to your chosen language, generate natural-sounding dubbed audio with the same emotional tone, and synchronize it perfectly with your video. The entire process is automated and typically takes just a few minutes, delivering professional-quality dubbed videos ready for global audiences.'

      question: 'What file formats are supported?',
      answer: 'For video dubbing, we support common formats like MP4, AVI, MOV, and MKV. Audio files can be WAV, MP3, or M4A. Our YouTube Summarizer works with any YouTube video URL. All processed files are returned in widely compatible formats for easy use.'
    },
    {
      question: 'How accurate is the translation?',
      answer: 'Our translations use Google Gemini AI, which provides highly accurate, context-aware translations. The AI understands idioms, cultural references, and maintains the original meaning while adapting to the target language naturally. For critical content, we recommend reviewing translations, but our accuracy rate is excellent for most use cases.'
